1. Check Locally (The "Sanity Test")
Before trusting the cloud, make sure your code runs on your machine.

Run Backend: In campusbytes/server, run node index.js. You should see Server on 5000 in the terminal.

Run Frontend: In campusbytes/client, npm run dev.

Action: Open the local URL (usually http://localhost:5173). If you see the blue "CampusBytes" header, your React and Tailwind setup is correct.
